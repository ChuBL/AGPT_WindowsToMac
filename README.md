Apple Game Porting Toolkit Installer

This public repository showcases using the brand-new **InstallAware Multi Platform** to completely automate the installation of Apple's new Game Porting Toolkit, making the process simple and point-and-click - even for non-developers!

**If you are not a developer and simply wish to be able to run PC apps (and games) on your Mac, you may download a ready-to-run app built from this sample, notarized by Apple, at the URL below:
www.installaware.com/iamp/agpt.dmg**

_This app works even on Intel Macs and does not require that you download the Apple Game Porting Toolkit from an Apple Developer account._

However, if you do have an Apple Silicon Mac and an Apple Developer account, this sample will also perform additional setup tasks to accelerate 3D games using Apple's brand-new technology.

Please note that you may run any Windows app using this sample, and are not limited to running games only.

If you are a developer, you may customize this sample following the steps below:

1) Please install **InstallAware Multi Platform** _RC0 Update 5_ or newer from www.installaware.com/iamp/rc0.dmg. If you have previously installed **InstallAware Multi Platform**, just run the built-in update tool to upgrade to this version.
2) Please double-click the **MPRX project file** in the _Finder_ to open this sample in the **InstallAware Multi Platform IDE**.

This sample demonstrates intermediate coding techniques using **InstallAware Multi Platform**.
