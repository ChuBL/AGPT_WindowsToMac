## Creating a Steam Shortcut
Follow the guide from [AppleGamingWiki](https://www.applegamingwiki.com/wiki/Game_Porting_Toolkit#Shortcut) to create a Steam shortcut using macOS's Automator app. Adjust `{path1}`, `{path2}`, and `{path3}` as per your system's directories.


1. **Open Automator**: Locate and open the Automator app on your Mac.
2. **Create a New Application**: In Automator, choose to create a new application.
3. **Run Shell Script**: In the actions panel, search for and select the 'Run Shell Script' action.
4. **Determine Paths**: You need to find three specific paths on your Mac:

   - **Wine Prefix Path (`{path1}`)**: This is the directory for `.wine`, typically found in your user directory. For example, `/Users/[YourUserName]/.wine`.

   - **Wine Binary Path (`{path2}`)**: Locate the `wine64` binary in the `game-porting-toolkit` directory. For example, `/usr/local/Cellar/game-porting-toolkit/1.1/bin/wine64`. Note that `1.1` is the version number, which may vary.

   - **Steam Executable Path (`{path3}`)**: The path to your Steam executable, usually `"C:\Program Files (x86)/Steam/steam.exe"`. Remember to include quotes due to spaces in the path.

5. **Enter the Script**: In the Automator script box, enter the following code, replacing `{path1}`, `{path2}`, and `{path3}` with your actual paths:

   ```
   MTL_HUD_ENABLED=0 WINEESYNC=1 WINEPREFIX="{path1}" "{path2}" "{path3}"
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   MTL_HUD_ENABLED=0 WINEESYNC=1 WINEPREFIX="/Users/John/.wine" "/usr/local/Cellar/game-porting-toolkit/1.1/bin/wine64" "C:\Program Files (x86)/Steam/steam.exe"
   ```

6. **Save the Application**: Save the Automator application, ideally in the Applications folder for easy access.
7. **Customize Shortcut (Optional)**: To add a custom icon, select the shortcut, press âŒ˜ Command+I to get info, and drag a PNG file onto the icon in the top left of the info window.

## Exiting Steam
Always use the Exit button in the Steam menu to prevent background processes from unintentionally relaunching Steam.
